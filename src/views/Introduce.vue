            Though the advancement of pre-trained large language models unfolds, the exploration of building a unified
            model for language and other multimodal data, such as motion, remains challenging and untouched so far.
            Fortunately, human motion displays a semantic coupling akin to human language, often perceived as a form of
            body language. By fusing language data with large-scale motion models, motion-language pre-training that can
            enhance the performance of motion-related tasks becomes feasible. Driven by this insight, we propose
            MotionGPT, a unified, versatile, and user-friendly motion-language model to handle multiple motion-relevant
            tasks. Specifically, we employ the discrete vector quantization for human motionand transfer 3D motion into
            motion tokens, similar to the generation process ofword tokens. Building upon this “motion vocabulary”, we
            perform language modeling on both motion and text in a unified manner, treating human motion as a specific
            language. Moreover, inspired by prompt learning, we pre-train MotionGPT with a mixture of motion-language
            data and fine-tune it on prompt-based question-and-answer tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
            MotionGPT achieves state-of-the-art performances on multiple motion tasks including text-driven motion
            generation, motion captioning, motion prediction, and motion in-between.

            To involve large language data and models in the motion generation tasks, we propose a unified
            motion-language framework named MotionGPT. MotionGPT consists of a motion tokenizer responsible for
            converting raw motion data into discrete motion tokens, as well as a motion-aware language model that learns
            to understand the motion tokens from large language pre-training models by corresponding textual
            descriptions.
